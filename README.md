# Library Search

Algorithmic exercise in golang.

## Problem statement
Given a flat file of book metadata, write a Library function that parses the book data and provides an API that lets you search for all books containing a word.

Your solution must have a runtime of faster than O(n) for the search api, with n representing the number of words in the library.
